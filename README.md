### Project: *SpinGuard CAPTCHA API Service*

Project Overview 
SpinGuard CAPTCHA is an innovative CAPTCHA API service designed to provide enhanced security for websites and applications through a spinning CAPTCHA mechanism. This service generates a unique 7-character CAPTCHA, incorporating a visual spinning wheel element that selects characters randomly. The service ensures that users complete a dynamic challenge before submitting forms, adding an additional layer of security to login, registration, and other critical actions.
The service is designed for ease of integration, allowing external websites to request CAPTCHAs and verify user responses via simple API endpoints. The API also includes features that detect suspicious behavior, such as linear mouse movements, ensuring a more robust challenge for potential bots.

### Key Features:

1. *CAPTCHA Generation*:
   - The service generates a 7-character CAPTCHA consisting of alphanumeric characters.
   - A random spinning wheel animation adds a visual element to CAPTCHA creation, making it more interactive for users.
   - The API allows developers to embed CAPTCHA challenges easily into their web forms.

2. *Cursor-Based Challenge*:
   - SpinGuard CAPTCHA monitors user mouse movements before allowing the wheel to spin.
   - If the cursor moves in a straight line (indicative of bot-like behavior), the CAPTCHA spin will not be triggered, adding an extra layer of human verification.

3. *REST API Integration*:
   - *GET /api/captcha*: This endpoint generates and returns a unique 7-character CAPTCHA.
   - *POST /api/verify*: This endpoint allows for CAPTCHA verification, taking the user’s input and the generated CAPTCHA, and returning a success or failure response.
   - The API follows REST principles, making it easy to integrate with any website or application.

4. *Security & Usability*:
   - The CAPTCHA is designed to be difficult for bots to solve, while remaining user-friendly for legitimate users.
   - CORS support ensures that websites from different origins can securely integrate with SpinGuard.
   - HTTPS is supported to ensure secure data transmission, keeping CAPTCHA results and verification requests safe from interception.
### Target Audience:

- *Developers*: Web developers and system administrators looking to implement an effective CAPTCHA system to protect forms from spam, automated submissions, and brute force attacks.
- *Businesses*: E-commerce websites, SaaS platforms, and any online service provider that requires user authentication and protection from bot traffic.

### Use Cases:

1. *Login and Registration Forms*: Prevent bots from creating multiple accounts or attempting brute force login attacks.
2. *Payment Forms*: Add an extra layer of security to ensure that payments are completed by humans and not malicious scripts.
3. *Comment Systems*: Protect blogs, forums, and content platforms from spam comments and automated inputs.
### Technical Stack:

- *Node.js with Express*: For building the backend RESTful API.
- *JavaScript (Client-side)*: To handle the CAPTCHA display and interaction on the frontend, including the spinning animation and mouse movement detection.
- *CORS*: To allow external sites to integrate the API securely.
- *HTTPS*: To provide secure transmission of CAPTCHA data between the API and its clients.

### Benefits:

Benefits:
Enhanced Security: The spinning CAPTCHA combined with cursor tracking makes it harder for bots to bypass the challenge.
User-Friendly: Despite its security strength, the CAPTCHA remains straightforward for human users to solve, ensuring a balance between security and usability.
Easy Integration: With simple API endpoints and REST architecture, developers can quickly embed SpinGuard CAPTCHA into their applications.
Future Plans:
API Key Management: Introducing API keys for authentication and usage tracking.
Customizable Captcha: Providing options for customizing CAPTCHA length, difficulty, and visual design.
Reporting & Analytics: Offering insights into CAPTCHA performance, including success/failure rates and suspicious activity detection.
SpinGuard CAPTCHA API Service aims to provide websites and online applications with a reliable, interactive, and secure solution for bot protection.

Technologies Used in SpinGuard CAPTCHA API Service Project:
Node.js:

A JavaScript runtime used to build the backend of the CAPTCHA API service.
Handles the server-side logic, API requests, and responses, and manages the generation and verification of CAPTCHAs.
Express.js:

A lightweight web application framework for Node.js, used to build the RESTful API.
Simplifies the creation of routes and handling HTTP requests (GET and POST) for CAPTCHA generation and verification.
JavaScript (Frontend and Backend):

Frontend: Used to handle user interaction with the CAPTCHA (fetching CAPTCHA via API, displaying CAPTCHA, handling form submission, etc.).

Backend: Used to implement the CAPTCHA logic (generating random characters, cursor movement tracking) and to manage API responses.
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):

Middleware in Node.js to allow cross-origin requests, ensuring that external websites can securely access the CAPTCHA API.
Enables integration of the API service across different domains, allowing other websites to use the CAPTCHA.
HTTPS (SSL/TLS):

Ensures secure transmission of CAPTCHA data and responses between the client and server, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks.
Encrypts communication for security-sensitive operations like CAPTCHA verification.
RESTful API:

Architecture used to structure the CAPTCHA service, with well-defined endpoints for CAPTCHA generation (GET /api/captcha) and CAPTCHA verification (POST /api/verify).
Ensures stateless communication, making the API scalable and easy to integrate.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Frontend):

HTML: Provides the structure of the CAPTCHA form and interaction elements (input fields, buttons, etc.).
CSS: Styles the CAPTCHA form, the spinning wheel, and other UI components to ensure a clean, user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Handles dynamic interaction, such as fetching the CAPTCHA, spinning the CAPTCHA wheel, monitoring cursor movement, and verifying the CAPTCHA input from users.
JSON:

Data format used to exchange information between the frontend (client) and the backend (API).
JSON responses include the CAPTCHA code (in GET requests) and verification results (in POST requests).
Conic Gradient (CSS):

Used to create the visual spinning wheel effect in the CAPTCHA UI.
CSS conic-gradient creates segments in the wheel, making the CAPTCHA visually engaging for users.
Middleware (Express.js):

Used to process incoming requests and manage tasks such as CORS handling, request parsing, and error handling.
Allows smooth flow between receiving an API request and returning an appropriate response.
Fetch API (JavaScript):

Used in the frontend to make asynchronous API requests to the CAPTCHA service.
Fetches the generated CAPTCHA and sends user input back to the server for verification without requiring page reloads.
Mouse Event Handling (JavaScript):

Listens for and tracks mouse movements to detect whether the cursor is moving in a straight line.
Adds another layer of human verification by allowing CAPTCHA spin only if the mouse movement is non-linear.
